**Course Title: Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)**   
**Instructor:** Yujie Zhang  
**Email:** yujie.zhang396@duke.edu \
**Office Hours:** 10:05 am - 11:20 am Monday and Wednesday  

### **Course Description**
This course introduces core Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) concepts, providing a foundation for advanced ECE topics. Key topics include techniques for analyzing linear circuits, semiconductor and photonic devices, frequency representation, filtering, and logic design (combinational and sequential). The course also integrates an extensive hands-on design challenge, culminating in a robot race competition where students apply sensor data acquisition and processing skills to navigate obstacles.

### **Prerequisite/Corequisite:**
- Engineering 103L or Computer Science 201  
- Mathematics 112L or 22, or equivalent  

### **Course Objectives**
By the end of this course, students will be able to:  
1. Analyze and design linear electrical circuits.
2. Understand the basic principles of semiconductor and photonic devices.
3. Apply frequency domain analysis and filtering techniques.
4. Design and implement combinational and sequential logic circuits.
5. Work effectively in teams to complete a practical design challenge.
6. Integrate theory and practical skills in a robotic system for competition.
